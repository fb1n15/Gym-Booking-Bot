# A Bot to Book Badminton Courts

## How to install

## Instructions
- Please run this command to book courts: `python main.py <username> <email> <password> <time>`
    - For example `python main.py fb6n50 fb6n50@soton.ac.uk 12345 15` (if I want to book a court at 15:00 for today one week later)
    - Sorry, if you want to book any courts within 6 days, this program won't help you.
- Please start the program after 05:00 and before 00:00. 
- The program will try to book a court at that time (any court) until 00:05 the next day.
- Please let me know if there is any bugs. (There should be many. ðŸ˜¹)
